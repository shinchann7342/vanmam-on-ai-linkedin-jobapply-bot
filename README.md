# Vanmam-on-AI LinkedIn JobApply Bot

This is the first step of expressing my pure hate towards AI job screening stuff that companies use to "screen" our application without even a human looking into it. We shouldn't take sticks and stones to a sword fight, right? So, here I am with a sword.


## Why this started? 
I once got a rejection mail for a job even before i got the application acknowledgement mail and that was the beginning of my Villan Arc, i felt a lot of emotions that day is my application not even worthy enough for a human to read? why can't a recruiter review the applications themselves, and then i realized something, yes they might be getting a lot of applications and they might not have the time to review them all, so i thought "If it is okay for recruiters to review and reject my application with AI then it should be okay for me to apply to the jobs with an AI right?" and so it began. and also one more thing, I thought why do recruiters post jobs in Entry Level with 8-9 Years of experience shouldn't entry level be 0-2 Years ? it has always frustated me and dont even get me started on ghost hiring, so here I'm where injustice prevails, a man caped in black, fighting the darkness, I'm Justice, I'm Batman 😅. aight enough story lets get to the point.


## How to Run?

1. This app requires you to have Python 3 at least. Download the latest version of Python from [https://www.python.org](https://www.python.org).

2. You need to run `first_run.bat` and give it your credentials (don't worry, everything stays in your system; you can give your details).
   
   > **PS:** All your details will be saved in the `user-config.txt` file created from `first_run.bat` (**remember to delete it before sharing this app to someone if you're doing so locally**).

3. Once your details are captured in `first_run.bat`, this app should do its job (i.e., getting you a job 😂... aight, jokes apart). This app will open a Selenium window and execute the code which automatically applies for the LinkedIn jobs which has EasyApply enabled and no other jobs.

    > **PS:** I hope you have already applied for a few jobs on linkedin for which you might have filled in your details along with your updated resume, try to update these details on linkedin itself and check if you have your updated resume on LinkedIn before starting the app.

4. Don't worry, you don't have to run the `first_run.bat` every time. Instead, once your details are filled, you can run the `run.bat` file every time you want to run this application.

5. If the app fails or an error is encountered, check the following:
   
   * **5.1.** The job application limit is reached in LinkedIn (50 Applications per day). You can check it by logging in to your LinkedIn app and try to apply for a job. If an error throws, then try applying the next day (IK the market is bad, bro 🥲 (bro is gender neutral 🗿) but you gotta wait 24 hours).
   
   * **5.2.** The app failed due to a network issue or something. Try restarting the app by executing the `run.bat` file. If it doesn't fix it, then pray 🥲.

6. If you want the Telegram notifications for the jobs that got applied, then you have to fill in the chat ID and Bot token. I have given the link to it in the app itself... aight, IK patience is not our strength for many of us (guilty myself). Here you go, here is the link: [https://youtu.be/l5YDtSLGhqk?si=W92w_Nl6mfcgomID](https://youtu.be/l5YDtSLGhqk?si=W92w_Nl6mfcgomID)

## Known Issues:
1. The app may sometimes get stuck on the application part, you can either restart the application manually or Use the Telegram Bot Functionality (ie. send "Restart" message from your Telegram Bot).

2. Same applies for ending the current execution (ie. send "End" message from your telegram bot to end the current execution)

> **Note:** Yes, I know my app is following a brute-force approach which is not ideal but hey, first rule of programming: "if it works, don't touch it."

### Data Collection
Bro, the app is running locally; I'm not collecting any data. Ah yes, about the API key and Years of Experience? That's a future implementation I'm working on, or probably I implemented it, I might not have updated this README... IDK, I'm writing it at 3:00 in the morning so I guess that's it. Happy job hunting.
