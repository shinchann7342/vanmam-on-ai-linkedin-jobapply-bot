# Vanmam-on-AI LinkedIn JobApply Bot

This is the first step of expressing my pure hate towards AI job screening stuff that companies use to "screen" our application without even a human looking into it. We shouldn't take sticks and stones to a sword fight, right? So, here I am with a sword.

## How to Run?

1. This app requires you to have Python 3 at least. Download the latest version of Python from [https://www.python.org](https://www.python.org).

2. You need to run `first_run.bat` and give it your credentials (don't worry, everything stays in your system; you can give your details).
   
   > **PS:** All your details will be saved in the `user-config.txt` file created from `first_run.bat` (**remember to delete it before sharing this app to someone if you're doing so locally**).

3. Once your details are captured in `first_run.bat`, this app should do its job (i.e., getting you a job 😂... aight, jokes apart). This app will open a Selenium window and execute the code which automatically applies for the LinkedIn jobs which has EasyApply enabled and no other jobs.

4. Don't worry, you don't have to run the `first_run.bat` every time. Instead, once your details are filled, you can run the `run.bat` file every time you want to run this application.

5. If the app fails or an error is encountered, check the following:
   
   * **5.1.** The job application limit is reached in LinkedIn (50 Applications per day). You can check it by logging in to your LinkedIn app and try to apply for a job. If an error throws, then try applying the next day (IK the market is bad, bro 🥲 (bro is gender neutral 🗿) but you gotta wait 24 hours).
   
   * **5.2.** The app failed due to a network issue or something. Try restarting the app by executing the `run.bat` file. If it doesn't fix it, then pray 🥲.

6. If you want the Telegram notifications for the jobs that got applied, then you have to fill in the chat ID and Bot token. I have given the link to it in the app itself... aight, IK patience is not our strength for many of us (guilty myself). Here you go, here is the link: [https://youtu.be/l5YDtSLGhqk?si=W92w_Nl6mfcgomID](https://youtu.be/l5YDtSLGhqk?si=W92w_Nl6mfcgomID)

> **Note:** Yes, I know my app is following a brute-force approach which is not ideal but hey, first rule of programming: "if it works, don't touch it."

### Data Collection
Bro, the app is running locally; I'm not collecting any data. Ah yes, about the API key and Years of Experience? That's a future implementation I'm working on, or probably I implemented it, I might not have updated this README... IDK, I'm writing it at 3:00 in the morning so I guess that's it. Happy job hunting.
